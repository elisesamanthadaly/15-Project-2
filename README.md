## Description

Our goal is to create an auction interface for role-playing gamers to buy/sell/trade in-game items for fun and profit.

INSERT MORE DESCRIPTION HERE

Tabletop Auction House uses JavaScript, Handlebars, MySQL/JawsDB, Heroku, Tailwind CSS, Book Brush, and a Favicon Generator. More technologies that we would like to add in the future include Cloudinary and RPG-Awesome.
